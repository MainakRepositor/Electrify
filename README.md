Goal was to create a User friendly interface using Streamlit, the Python package, where a circuit simulation can be run.
The User should be able to choose an input voltage, a number of resistors and their resistances.
  I also added the option to have resistors in series or in parallel.
The ouput had to be the Total Current and the Voltage Drop at each resistor, along with a standard circuit diagram or a plot of the voltage profile.

- I used Schemdraw to create the standard circuit diagram.
- I used Matplotlib.pyplot to graph the voltage profile.
- I used Streamlit as required to make it interactive and easy to follow.
